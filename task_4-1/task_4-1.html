      <li>Why is object-oriented development so important in programming?</li>
      <p>Objects are a keystone in programming because it makes it easier to reuse behaviors in certain progams. Instead of rewrite and use built inn features, it gives the programmer <br>
      the possibility to costumize behavors.</p>

      <li>In Task 1, we create a static object called "AccountType." Explain what this object is used for and <br>
        how this type of object can help us in software development.</li>
      <p>The object AccountType is a key example of how there is only those four configurations we can choose under AccountTypes in the code, <br>
      It makes it easier in the long run to declare a set of rules in the class and preventing errors.</p>

      <li>Discuss why we use encapsulation in classes. Why do we want to "hide" code within our class? <br>
        Explain how we can create "private" and "public" members in a constructor function.</li>
      <p>Encapsulation is to add aditional functions and properties to classes, the reason to hide code in classes it because of missuse and privacy. <br>
      Using the "#" gives the posibility to private funcions in a constructor.</p>

      <li>Explain what happens when we use the "new" command in JavaScript.</li>
      <p>Using the new command will add the rules from the class it refers, and ads the variables and values in the constructor to the variable name used to the new class.<br>
      Thereby making a new object with the variable.</p>
