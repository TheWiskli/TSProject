      <li>What is an array? A short and concise answer is expected here!</li>
      <p>An array is a structure that stores a list of elements of the same type, that is accessible by a number called an index.</p>
      
      <li>What does it mean to "hardcode" when we talk about programming? (In English, it's called "hard
        coding", "hard-coding", or "hardcoding").</li>
      <p>When writing code, hardcoding means that we write fixed values in the code rather than get it from users, files or a database.</p>
      
      <li>Explain in plain text what happens in task 3, and how we can traverse (iterate) the array when we
        (humans) don't "know" how long the array is.</li>
      <p>By using the .split() we make that every word in the string is added as an item to the a new array.</p>
      <p>And using the .every() with the right functions like everyWord() it goes trough all items in the array and prints out it's index and the word associaded with it.</p>
      <p>in my code i have added an +1 on my inex to make it more understandeble for the simpler person.</p>

      <li>Why is it beneficial to store instances of a class in arrays, as in task 4?</li>
      <p> Probably task 6 you are talking about...</p>
      <p>It is beneficial to store instances of a class in arrays because it allows us to group similar objects together, making it easier to manage and manipulate them as a single collection.</p>
      
      <li>Try your best to explain the EWeekDays object from task 7. How do we use the "value" attribute, for
        example? In what way do "WeekDay", "Workdays", and "Weekends" differ from each other? If we
        wanted to create a new element "WorkoutDays", which would contain "Monday", "Wednesday", and
        "Thursday", how would it ideally look? (I will choose the best answer to this task and reward it with
        pizza in the cafeteria right after New Year. Remember to mark in your submission if you want to
        participate in the competition!)</li>
      <p>Good question! I would probably make it like this in the code: </p> 
      <p>"WorkoutDays: { value: 0x01 + 0x04 + 0x08, name: "Treningsdager" }"</p> 
      <p>and the result would be this:</p>
      <p>WorkoutDays: value: 13, name: Treningsdager</p>
      <p>but the reason why we use the values is to make it smaller in storage size, but also makes it efficient with the machine code and are more compact.</p>
      
      <li>In task 8, we will use a "callback" routine when sorting. Explain how such a "callback" routine works.</li>
      <p>by using the sort() method with a function that dictates numbes, we can sort it easly because it compares the values instead of just the first number.</p>
      <p>For example: if we have a function that compares two numbers, it will return -1 if the first number is smaller than the second, 0 if they are equal, and 1 if the first number is larger than the second.</p>
      <p>The sort() is only comparing from the first number in its value so it cannont sort it out on its own.</p>

      <li>What happens in the sorting routines you have created? Try to explain how the array can figure out
        if an element should come before or after another. The best way to answer this is to actually print
        both parameters each time the sorting routine runs.</li>
      <p>as explained in the last question, it compares between two numbers where it tests if it is less then, equals or more than the first number</p>
      <p>and then it returns the value of -1, 0 or 1 to the sort() method and it will sort it out for you.</p>
      <p>and if you print out the values it will show you the numbers that are being compared.</p>
      
      <li>In task 10, we will create an array with rows and columns. Explain what the first element of the array
        contains.</li>
      <p>It contains the arrays index of the row it is on, it always starts on 0, and works its way on the row and then starts on it's next row after.</p>
