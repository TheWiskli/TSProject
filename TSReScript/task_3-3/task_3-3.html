      <li>What is the difference between invoking and creating a function?</li>
      <p>Invoking a function is to use a pre-exstisting function that is made by the makers of the programming language, <br>
      or someone else who has created a function for a spesific job. When creating your own function, you have a clear sheet of <br>
      how the funcion is gonna world and can invoke it by your own merits.</p>

      <li>Explain the syntax regarding semicolons and code blocks.</li>
      <p>Semicolons in JavaScript are to be used as a marking of end of a line of code, it is to terminate the statement of the codeline.<br>
      Codeblocks is to group up codes to be used under spesial structures like conditions, functions and loop as an example. </p>

      <li>What happens when we try to store values from a function when it doesn't return any?</li>
      <p>So long as we set a "return" with what value we want to store the function will store it. Without it, it can only <br>
      be used as an situational reason.</p>

      <li>How do we separate parameters from each other when creating a function?</li>
      <p>In JavaScript, parameters are seperated by commas to describe difirent values. Unlike some other languages, in <br> 
        JS isn't it a nessesary to declare what type of value the parameters are to be used in the function.</p>

      <li>Explain how parameter names are related during the invocation and creation of a function.</li>
      <p>Parameter names are placeholders of what the variable represents in the code. It makes it easier to understand its meaning in the function.</p>

      <li>Explain why a parameter is undefined when a function call is missing a parameter.</li>
      <p>It triggers when there is a parameter what hasn't been given a value that is a nessesity for the funcion, most modern programs has coded in a failsafe <br>
      to prevent users to exploit these holes.</p>

      <li>Explain what happens when we use recursive functions.</li>
      <p>Recusive functios are funcions that run themself as a loop until a certain event breaks the loop, an example is the factorial function form part 10 <br>
      that breaks down the selected number in the parameter until 0 is the only number that triggers the last return.</p>
