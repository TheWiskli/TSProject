      <li>In part 1, is it possible to to solve the problem using a single "for" loop?</li>
      
        <p>
          There is a possabillity to do this by combining the two by changing the minus variable to count from 11 and backwards.<br> 
          Taking my code as an example. if I change line 18 to following: <br>
         <br>
        txtPrintValueMinus += (11 - count).toString()<br>
         <br>
          and the if sentence on line 19 to the same as it's predesessor on line 12, and remove the for loop at line 17. <br> 
          You get a working loop of numbers. The only reason why I haven't done this is because it makes greater <br> 
          chanses to create bugs if you were gonna change the count variable, and the code looks much cleaner.
        </p>

      <li>In part 2, can we create what is known as an "infinite" loop within the condition of the while loop?</li>
      
        <p>The easyest way is to give it a task that is imposible to solve in the loop, an example is to change<br> 
          the guessed number to a number outside the "math.random" barrier like 61 or something higher og below 0</p>
      
      <li>Discuss briefly how quickly or slowly a computer might be able to compute this,<br> 
        considering the number of guesses and the time it takes. <br>
        How does the program behave while it is guessing? <br>
        Can the program perform other tasks concurrently?</li>
      
        <p>While it is going through a loop in the program, it would refuse to show anything from the codes that is attached in the same javascript file.<br>
        it will show everything after it is finished.<br>
        <br>
        And just like all other programming languages. Javascript has to read the code from top to bottom, if there is a hiccup on the way down it wouldn't jump over the code untill it is finished.</p>
      
      <li>Explain the relationship between rows and columns in nested "for" loops.<br> 
        Can we, for instance, change the order, considering rows to be innermost or columns to be innermost, <br>
        or does this not matter?</li>
      
        <p>I does matter. Depending what you are making, using the rows and columns would change the output on how the result would look, <br> 
          the columns woudnt give the right amount of data per row as requested in the task.<br> 
          Task 5 is basically showing us that it will always do the nested loops first before continuing<br>
          the outer ones.</p>
