      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 1, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>Since we use === in this part of the task, the program would not run because it would only expect the number 7, <br> 
        however if the number is 7 it would run the code an say that we can take the bus </p>
      
      <li>Same as question #1. How ever the answer should now be different. Discuss the behaviour of part 2, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>In this part we change the === to a <= and have an else for the posibility for the car. It Would give posibility for two different scenarios depending on if the time is over 7 o'clock.</p>
      
      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 3, what happens when wake time is less than 7 or greater than 8?</li>
      <p>The same as last question. only this time there was a third option with a train that was between 7 and 8.</p>
      
      <li>Discuss the behavior for part 4, what happens if the number is exactly 0, is zero positive or negative?</li>
      <p>Zero is Zero, but since it refers to part 4, it would not print out the answer because zero wasn't declared as an posibility.</p>
